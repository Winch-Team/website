Installing through cURL is made easy. We host a shell script on our website that you can easily run using the following command:

```sh
curl -sSf https://install.winchteam.dev/install-winch.sh | sh
```

This should install winch to your computer, and add it to the path so you can use it anywhere. You might have to reload your shell enviornment to take this into effect.
